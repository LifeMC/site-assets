# site-assets
Public site assets for the LifeMC site.

# img
Contains the images. Preference order: AVIF > WebP > JPG > PNG.

The PNG can be more qualitive but for speed, AVIF is best.

# css
Contains the styles. All of them should be minimized.

If there are third party styles there, that means we've edited them
to increase performance.

# fonts
Contains the fonts. Can contain all font types, but WOFF 2.0 is preferred.

All of them should be loaded with font-display: swap to increase performance.
